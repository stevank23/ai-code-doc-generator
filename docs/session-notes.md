# Development Log

## Session 1 - 2026-01-29
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Completed
- Repository structure created
- Architecture designed and documented
- CodeLlama-7B loaded successfully
- Basic documentation generation working
- Tested on 3 different functions

### Observations
- Model loaded successfully on T4 GPU
- Generation takes ~5-10 seconds per function
- Output quality is decent but needs refinement
- Prompt engineering will be key to improvement

### Key Learnings
- CodeLlama-7B works well on free Colab tier
- Initial results are promising
- Need to add evaluation metrics in next session

### Next Session Goals
- Parse Python files with AST
- Extract function signatures automatically
- Improve prompt engineering
- Add multiple documentation styles
- Build evaluation framework
